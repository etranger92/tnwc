              "QTLS (Qualified Teacher Learning and Skills) status is the badge of professionalism for post-14 education and training, helping practitioners advance in their careers and demonstrate their expertise and experience to colleagues, employers and learners. SET members can gain QTLS status by successfully completing professional formation.",
              "Since April 2012, teachers and trainers holding QTLS status who are also members of SET have been recognised in legislation as equivalent in status to teachers with QTS in schools. Holders of QTLS are able to teach across all subjects and all ages on equal pay and conditions, opening up career development and wider employment opportunities.",
